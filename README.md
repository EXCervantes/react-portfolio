## Description

Here is an updated Portfolio using all that I have learned these past few months. This is built using React and its corresponding packages, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite React. Due to using a virtual DOM this webpage acts like a true single page application as seen by how the user can interact with it. This project is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a webpage which can be used in the browser.

Building this site taught me many new things about building with React.js especially the ease of using it once I became familiar with the syntax. There has been some huge improvements over my [previous](https://github.com/EXCervantes/portfolio-page) Portfolio page. Future development will include creating a full functioning form page which will interact with an API such as Email.js to notify of a response.

## Technologies and Packages Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [React.js](https://react.dev/)
- [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Flowbite React](https://flowbite-react.com/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Installation

This is a full functioning application deployed at [this link](https://edwardo-cervantes-portfolio.netlify.app/).

Alternatively, a user can clone the repository to view it on their local machine. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the page to work. Initailize the application by using `npm run start`.

## Usage

Once the page is open a user can navigate it via the menu at top or the user can scroll down to find the site will load each "page" of the website automatically. Clicking on an image of a project will take the user to that respective project's deployment page. Please note, the form does not currently send a notification upon submission. This will be implemented soon.
