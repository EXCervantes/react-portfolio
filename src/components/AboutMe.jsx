        My name is Edwardo Cervantes, soon to be full-stack developer with an eye for graphic design. I like to make things look pretty and as best they can be while also being easy to access and use. You could say I am a geek at heart and fan of computers who loves to seek out challenging mind racking things.

        My previous line of work told me one thing: working with computers was alway my true calling. My grade school days involved me glued to a computer during our free time in class always fascinated with how programs worked. Years later now the picture is clearer with my experience in coding and creating fun projects.
